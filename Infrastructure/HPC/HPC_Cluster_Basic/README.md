# HPC Cluster Basic
This tutorial will go over how to deploy an Oracle HPC Cluster using Oracle's Cloud Marketplace. Additional topics include:
* How to utilize Oracle Cloud (OCI) CLI commands and Terraform to work with the HPC Cluster
* Run OpenFoam Projects on the HPC Cluster
* Run OpenFoam Projects on a Standard Virtual Machine (Not a HPC Bare Metal Machine)

## (1) Generating SSH Keys
Before provisioning the HPC Cluster to the Cloud, we will generate SSH Key's. Depending on the OS, methods will vary. For this example, the SSH Key will be generate on a MacOS.

1. Start up the Terminal and type in the command: ssh-keygen
2. Verify that the keys (private and public) were generated by going to the location where you saved them (by default it is in ~/.ssh folder)
3. Always keep the private key PRIVATE, the public key will be uploaded to different systems in the future.

## (2) HPC Cluster from Oracle Cloud Marketplace
In this step, the HPC Cluster will be created through an existing Image available on Oracle Cloud's Marketplace and deployed on Oracle Cloud's Infrastructure

What's Included in the HPC Image (Architecture):

2. Configure the Stack:
   1. Stack Information:
      1. Give it a name, description, select your compartment.
