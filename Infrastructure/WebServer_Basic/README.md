** Background: **
In this tutorial, we will create a basic web server using Apache and PHP on an Oracle Linux VM Instance.

The Web Server will be hosted in a private subnet to provide best security. A Load Balancer will be created in a public subnet, giving clients a way to access the Web Server and providing best practice, security, and HA for the Web Server. A Bastion Host (aka Proxy Server) in a public subnet will be used to give Admin(s) and Developer(s) access to the Web Server.

It will go over the following topics/services:
* Networking
* Computes (Virtual Machines)
* Load Balancing

# Steps...
## (1) Create Virtual Cloud Network
Utilize the “Start VCN Wizard” to create a bundled VCN with Internet Connectivity (includes Public/Private Subnet, Internet/NAT/Service Gateway, etc.). This option allows you to create a network with a few clicks versus having to build out everything by scratch.

2. Give Basic Information like VCN Name and VCN/Subnet CIDR Blocks. Then click “Create”

## (2) Setup Subnets + Security Lists + Route Tables
