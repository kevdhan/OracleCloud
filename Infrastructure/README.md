## HPC
This is a tutorial going over how to create an HPC Cluster on Oracle Infrastructure using an HPC Cluster image provided in the marketplace.
Currently, due to lack of resources creation of the HPC Cluster stack is not doable. Will come back to this once resources are available or rather will showcase how to create an instance pool!

## WebServer_Basic
This is a tutorial going over how to create a Web Server Application on OCI. Rather than focusing on web development, this tutorial will focus more on how to create the infrastructure (Networks, Subnets, Setting up firewall/security rules, Virtual Machine to host the Web Server, Bastion Host - kind of like a proxy server, and more!).

In its current nature, the process is a bit on the manual side, but eventually a Terraform side will be uploaded!
